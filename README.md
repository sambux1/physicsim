# PhysicSim
Physical Simulation Library with Python and C++

## Roadmap

- [ ] v0.1 - First Steps
    - [ ] Particle class
    - [ ] 2D shape class with a handful of shapes inheriting from it
    - [ ] Python interface using Boost.Python
- [ ] v0.2 - Basic Interactions
    - [ ] one dimensional collisions
    - [ ] basic forces
    - [ ] convert to Python
- [ ] v0.3 - Sandbox
    - [ ] graphical representation of objects
    - [ ] basic demos
    - [ ] begin test suite

## Future Topics to Consider
- best way to handle collisions
- the Lagrangian
- rotation, torque, moment of inertia
